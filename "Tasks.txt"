Subject: Invitation for the user study - Visual System Evaluation for Explaination of Document Clustering.
Hello, 

I am writing to introduce you to a research project that we are currently conducting titled "Explainable Document Clustering Leveraging Knowledge Graph." The purpose of this study is to improve the explainability of deep learning models for document clustering in natural language processing. We have developed a knowledge graph-based approach that provides insights into the model's decision-making processes. 

To evaluate the goodness and user satisfaction of the proposed explainable system, we have constructed an interactive visual system that articulates the rationale of the decision-making during document clustering. We would like to invite you to participate in this user study by interacting with our interactive visual system. 

To participate in this study, you must be proficient in English, have access to a computer with internet connection suitable for audio-video conferencing (screen share only) using MS Teams, and have a basic understanding of text clustering. The participant does not have to be exclusively a student. 

To express our gratitude for your participation, we will provide a compensation of $20 to each participant. If you are interested in participating or need any further information about the user study, please do not hesitate to contact me. We value your input and look forward to hearing from you soon. 


Please respond YES to agree to participate.


Thank you for your time and consideration. 


Sincerely,
