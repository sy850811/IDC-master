Subject: Invitation for the user study - Visual System Evaluation for Explaination of Document Clustering.

Hello, 

I'm reaching out to introduce you to a research project that we are currently conducting titled "Explainable Document Clustering Leveraging Knowledge Graph." The purpose of this study is to improve the explainability of deep learning models for document clustering in natural language processing. We have developed a knowledge graph-based approach that provides insights into the model's decision-making processes. 

To evaluate the goodness and user satisfaction of the proposed explainable system, we have constructed an interactive visual system that articulates the rationale of the decision-making during document clustering. We would like to invite you to participate in this user study by interacting with our interactive visual system. 

To participate in this study, you must be proficient in English, have access to a computer with internet connection suitable for audio-video conferencing (screen share only), and have a basic understanding of text clustering. The participant does not have to be exclusively a student. 

To express our gratitude for your participation, we will provide a compensation of $20 to each participant. If you are interested in participating or need any further information about the user study, please do not hesitate to contact me at sy850811@dal.ca. We value your input and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Subject: Congratulations on Passing the Screening Questionnaire!

Dear [Participant's Name],

Congratulations on successfully passing the screening questionnaire for our user study titled "Visual System Evaluation for Explanation of Document Clustering"! We greatly appreciate your interest and participation.

As the next step, we invite you to interact with our tool. The tool will guide you through a tutorial to familiarize you with its features and functionalities. Following the tutorial, you will be asked to evaluate the explanations provided for 20 examples. After completing the evaluation, you will need to proceed with a questionnaire consisting of 35 questions to conclude the user study. The entire study, including the questionnaires, should take between 60 to 90 minutes to complete.

To access the tool, please use the following link: http://13.51.19.177//

Thank you once again for your participation and valuable contribution to our research project.

Should you have any questions or require assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out at sy850811@dal.ca
